To update a Webpacker v3.5 app to v4, follow these steps:

1. Update the `webpacker` gem and the `@rails/webpacker` package to v4. This will upgrade webpack itself from 3.x to 4.x, make sure you're aware of [any deprecations which might effect you](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/4/). Also make sure any other packages you depend on support webpack 4 and don't require any changes, e.g. if you explicitly include `webpack` you need to upgrade it to 4.x, and if you use `webpack-dev-server` you need to upgrade it to 3.x.
1. Browser support definitions have been moved to [`.browserslistrc`](../lib/install/config/.browserslistrc) to `/`.
1. Merge any differences between [`config/webpacker.yml`](../lib/install/config/webpacker.yml) and your `config/webpacker.yml`.
1. Webpacker v4 upgrades Babel to [v7](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration), see also [the release blog post](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0). Many packages were moved to the `@babel/` namespace, any babel plugins you have will need to be updated. It may be worth checking out [babel-upgrade](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade) if you have problems. ([#1564](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/1564))
1. `.babelrc` should be replaced with `babel.config.js` and `.postcssrc.yml` should be replaced with `postcss.config.js` ([#1822](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/1822)). If you never changed these files from their defaults, the versions of [babel.config.js](../lib/install/config/babel.config.js) and [postcss.config.js](../lib/install/config/postcss.config.js) in the webpacker repository should be usable.
1. Due to the change in [#1625](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/1625), you'll want to make sure that `extract_css` is set to true for the `default` environment in `webpacker.yml` if you want to have Webpacker supply your CSS.

### Add SplitChunks

If you used the `CommonsChunkPlugin` you'll need to upgrade to using the new `splitChunks`.

Originally, chunks (and modules imported inside them) were connected by a parent-child relationship in the internal webpack graph. The `CommonsChunkPlugin` was used to avoid duplicated dependencies across them, but further optimizations were not possible.

In webpack v4, `CommonsChunkPlugin` was removed in favor of `optimization.splitChunks`.

For the full configuration options of `splitChunks`, see the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/).

```js
// config/webpack/environment.js
const WebpackAssetsManifest = require('webpack-assets-manifest');

// Enable the default config
environment.splitChunks()

// or using custom config
environment.splitChunks((config) => Object.assign({}, config, { optimization: { splitChunks: false }}))
```

Then use, `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag` helper to include all the transpiled
packs with the chunks in your view, which creates html tags for all the chunks.

```erb
<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>

<!-- would create the following: -->
<script src="/packs/vendor-16838bab065ae1e314.js" data-turbolinks-track="reload"></script>
<script src="/packs/calendar~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js" data-turbolinks-track="reload"></script>
<script src="/packs/calendar-1016838bab065ae1e314.js" data-turbolinks-track="reload"></script>
<script src="/packs/map~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js" data-turbolinks-track="reload"></script>
<script src="/packs/map-16838bab065ae1e314.js" data-turbolinks-track="reload"></script>
```

**Important:** Pass all your pack names when using this helper otherwise you will
get duplicated chunks on the page.

```erb
<%# DO %>
<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map' %>

<%# DON'T %>
<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar' %>
<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'map' %>
```

### Package-specific notes:

- If you're using React, you need to add `"@babel/preset-react"`, to the list of `presets` in your babel config.
- If you're using Vue Loader, you'll need to upgrade to [v15](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/migrating.html) for webpack 4.
- To see what webpacker generates for a given framework with v4, you may want to re-run `bundle exec rake webpacker:install:FRAMEWORK` and let it override the files for your given JavaScript framework, and then compare them to see what changes you'll need to make.

### Example upgrades

This is what an upgrade to Webpacker 4 looked like for existing Rails apps (please contribute yours!):
