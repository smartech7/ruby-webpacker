# Singleton registry for accessing the digested filenames computed by Webpack in production mode.
# This allows javascript_pack_tag to take a reference to, say, "calendar.js" and turn it into 
# "calendar-1016838bab065ae1e314.js". These digested filenames are what enables you to long-term
# cache things in production.
